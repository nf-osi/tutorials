        "In cancer biology, the \"tumor microenvironment\" (TME) comprises the immune cells, extracellular matrix, blood vessels and various additional tissue-resident cell types that are part of the tumor ecosystem [^1]. Here we are interested in one important component, the composition of different immune cell types. However, there isn't always direct data from more cell assays like immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and mass cytometry for quantifying immune infiltrates. For the JHU Biobank, for example, only sequencing data is available.\n",

        "Fortunately, RNA-seq data can be used to characterize TME through a number of computational approaches. One highly used \"tumor deconvolution\" method is CIBERSORT[^2], which is available programmatically through R and a Python implementation via the TumorDecon package[^3]. (Other approaches are helpfully reviewed and benchmarked in [^4] and [^5].)\n",
